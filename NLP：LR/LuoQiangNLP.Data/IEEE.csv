Text classification mainly includes several steps such as word segmentation, feature selection, weight calculation and classification performance evaluation. Among them, feature selection is a key step in text classification, which affects the classification accuracy. Feature selection can help indicate the relevance of text contents and can better classify the text. Meanwhile feature selection has a great influence on the classification result. Text classification is a very important module in text processing, and it is widely applied in areas like spam filtering, news classification, sentiment classification, and part-of-speech tagging. This paper proposes a method for extracting feature words based on Chi-square Statistics. Because the feature words that appear together or separately may differ in different situations, we classify texts by using single word and double words as features at the same time. Based on our method, we performed experiments using classical Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classification algorithms. The efficiency of our method was demonstrated by the comparison and analysis of experimental results.","","","10.1109/ICSESS.2018.8663882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663882","text classification;feature selection;Chi-square Statistics","Text categorization;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Internet;Manuals;Machine learning;Entropy","Bayes methods;feature extraction;feature selection;pattern classification;statistical analysis;text analysis;word processing","feature selection method;text classification;text categories;text content;weight calculation;classification performance evaluation;text processing;news classification;sentiment classification;feature words;Chi-square statistics;support vector machine classification algorithms;Naive Bayes;spam filtering;part-of-speech tagging","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But with the continuous development of information technology, the amount of disorder data is increasing. How to organize the text and make automatically text classification has become a challenge. The traditional manual classification of news text not only consumes a lot of human and financial resources, but also hardly achieved classification task quickly. In this paper, the paper mainly makes a research about the news text classification. It proposes a news text classification model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Due to the dimension of the news texts is too high, this model uses topic model to make text dimension reduced and get features. At the same time, the paper also makes a research on Softmax regression algorithm to solve multi-class of text problems in our life and make it as model's classifier. The paper evaluates proposed model on a real news dataset and the result of the experiment shows the improved model performs relatively well. The model can effectively reduce the features dimension of the news text and get good classification results.","","","10.1109/ICIS.2016.7550929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7550929","topic model;softmax regression;text classification","Text categorization;Classification algorithms;Data models;Training;Resource management;Logistics;Machine learning algorithms","pattern classification;publishing;regression analysis;text analysis;Web sites","news text classification model;topic model;news Web sites;disorder data;text organization;automatical text classification;latent dirichlet allocation;LDA;news texts dimension reduction;Softmax regression algorithm;text problem multiclass solution","","2","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cosine Similarity and Euclidean Distance have been usedasthe similarity measures on the vector space model based on TF-IDF feature. The domains of interest are Business, State, Medical, Sports, and Science texts which are used as inputs for analysis. The recognition accuracy of 95.80% for Cosine Similarity and 95.20% for Euclidean Distanceare achieved on 1000 text documents. This confirms that unsupervised feature extraction technique may be treated as one of the useful methods for automatic text classification in Bangla (and for other Indian language documents), if input texts are not pre-classified based on certain predefined linguistic or statistical parameters. Comparative experiments on the dataset using several classification algorithm show that the distance measures perform better compare to other classifiers.","","","10.1109/ICACCAF.2017.8344721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8344721","Text Classification;Bangla;TF-IDF;Cosine similarity;Euclidean distance;β0 threshold value","Text categorization;Classification algorithms;Euclidean distance;Mathematical model;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Training","feature extraction;natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis","unsupervised feature extraction technique;automatic text classification;Indian language documents;distance measurement;multidomain Bangla text documents;categorizing Bangla text documents;Cosine Similarity;Euclidean Distance;usedasthe similarity measures;vector space model;TF-IDF feature;Science texts;Euclidean Distanceare;text documents","","2","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For text classification, the text contents are reduced to a more structured form by being preprocessed. Many studies have examined how these preprocesses affect the performance of classification algorithms. The main question of this study is how the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is noteworthy with its classification success, is influenced by text preprocessing in the text classification. In this study, the effect of text preprocessing is examined CNN classification performance on two different data sets with Turkish content. As a result of the study, it has been determined that the text preprocessing has a weak positive effect on CNN classification performance.","","","10.1109/IDAP.2018.8620722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8620722","Text Classification;Convolutional Neural Networks;Text Preprocessing","Text categorization;Convolutional neural networks;Twitter;Classification algorithms;Graphics processing units;Deep learning;Computer science","convolutional neural nets;natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis","Turkish text;text classification;text contents;classification algorithms;text preprocessing;CNN classification performance;Turkish content;convolutional neural networks","","1","","0","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
